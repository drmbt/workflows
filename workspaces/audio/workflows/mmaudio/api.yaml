name: Create Movie Sync Audio
description: Generate music and sound effects with MMAUDIO.

  This tool uses mmaudio model, which is generates short audio samples, sound effects, and production elements syncronized to an input video. Ideal for loops and stems rather than full audio arrangements. It should be the default choice for creating audio when provided a video clip as an input.

    tip: |-
      This tool works best with a single shot, scene or clip, but can also create audio for a longer edit. This tool will likely ignore syncronizing elements in subsequent cuts that were not present in the first shot however, so only use this for longer edits when you want the audio to carry over from the first scene.

    description: Describe the music or sound effect to make
    tip: |-
      This prompt should either describe backing music like an upbeat ambient soundtrack for an epic action scene, or specific sound effect elements present in the video such as footsteps, fire crackling, waves crashing, a hammer hitting a rock etc. It doesn't do well with descriptions for both, so it is best to generate the sound effects per individual video clip with this endpoint, and music as a nother pass with this or another audio tool.
