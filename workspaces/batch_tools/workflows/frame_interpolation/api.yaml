name: Keyframe Interpolation
description: Create a video from keyframe images through visual interpolation.
thumbnail: app/frame_interpolation_opt.mp4
tip: This workflow creates animations from a set of images that linearly connect those images into a visual, morphing video. The number of frames between each keyframe can be adjusted to create a smooth transition. The video can be looped back to the first frame to create a seamless loop.

- name: FPS
  label: Output Video Framerate
  description: target output video framerate
  tip: The output video will be confromed to this framerate. This should stay at the default unless another FPS is specified by the user. Other common framerates are 60fps, 30fps(broadcast default), 24fps (cinema), or 12fps (anime). This parameter does not set the number of frames, only the rate at which the video conforms the total n_frames.

- name: loop
  label: Loop
  description: Make the animation a seamless loop by interpolating back to the first image
  tip: This will force the last frame to be identical to the first and make a seamless loop. Unless specifically requested, this should be kept at False (default).

    field: inputs
    subfield: value
- name: sort
  label: Sort Method
  description: Method for sorting the keyframes. The visual_path method automatically puts visually similar images next to each other.
  tip: This parameter should usually stay at the default of None to preserve the input order, but occasionally a random order may be desired by the user. The visual_path method should be used for a batch of images that a user wants ordered optimally for smoothest interpolation sequencing, but you should always inform the user that you are providing this optimization if this option is being selected.

  default: None

- name: pingpong
  label: Forward-Reverse Loop (pingpong)
  description: Make the animation a seamless loop by concatenating a forward and reversed version of the animation. This term is sometimes called bounce or pingpong; the video will play forwards and then reverse itself back to the beginning.
  tip: This will force the last frame to be identical to the first and make a seamless loop. Unless specifically requested, this should be kept at False (default).

- name: reverse_order
  label: Reverse Order
  description: This toggle reverses the list order of image sequences.
  tip: This should usually stay false, but if a user asks to flip it, its nice to sort backwards alphabetically, or when sort by visual_path is enabled and the user wants the video to flow in the opposite direction.
