  description: Textual description of the region to inpaint.
  tip: This prompt will be used to highlight the object/region to inpaint, creating a mask. Try to make this prompt as short, clean and simple as possible. use single words instead of full sentences. Some examples of good masking prompts are 'face', 'building', 'hair, headwear, hat', ...

  description: Make the inpainting region slightly larger to make the results more realistic
  tip: The default is typically fine. If the masking prompt is targetting a small object, but the inpainting object is something larger, you may want to increase this value to give the inpainting model enough space to draw the new thing. If the inpainting region needs to be very precise you can very rarely decrease this value to eg 24.

  description: Make the inpainting region blurry at the edges to make the results more realistic
  tip: The default is typically fine. If the mask has lots of fine edges, you can consider tuning this down to avoid erasing the details in the mask.
