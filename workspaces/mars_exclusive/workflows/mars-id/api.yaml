thumbnail: app/mars-id_opt.jpg
tip: This is a tool for students of Mars College to create a Student ID card. This tool does not generate the portrait image, it requires a user supplied image to populate a generative form filled ID card template. If a user wants an image of a character or to use a LoRA or ipadapter for their portrait image, create that first with another tool and use that output as the portrait image input required by this tool.
