name: Temple Abyss Card Generator
description: Create a custom Temple Abyss CCG card with background art generation and card layout composition.
tip: |-
  This tool generates custom Temple Abyss CCG cards. You can either generate new card art or use an existing rendered image.
  The workflow combines generated or supplied art with card template elements including clan icons, rarity markers, and card text.
  For best results, provide detailed prompts for the art generation and ensure text fits within standard card layout constraints.

    tip: |-
      Use best judgement based on the supplied image and user request to select the correct controlnet preprocessor and model to suit their needs. Canny detects thin binary edges and is useful for tasks requiring fast edge detection, such as architectural designs or simple object outlines, but it may struggle with complex scenes or noise. Depth generates luminance-based depth maps and is ideal for creating realistic 3D-like compositions, such as emphasizing depth in landscapes or isolating foreground objects. HED excels at producing smooth, intricate edge detection and is suitable for detailed illustrations, artistic line work, or noise-sensitive scenes. OpenPose identifies human keypoints, making it a perfect choice for generating images with accurate human poses, such as action shots, dance scenes, or character positioning, but will fail if a person isn't detected, so only use this one if you have reason to believe an image containing a person was provided as init. LineArt converts images into detailed line drawings and is best for black-and-white artwork, manga-style illustrations, or clear contrast outlines. Scribble processes rough sketches into structured inputs, ideal for refining rough concepts or integrating hand-drawn elements into finished compositions with a sketch-like aesthetic.
