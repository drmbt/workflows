tip: |-
  Creative image animation using AnimateDiff. This tool will apply subtle and artistic motion to an input image, and optionally apply a style effect.
  By default, this tool applies a looping 3D warping effect which can be turned off.
  If the image has a sensitive or very specific foreground subject (like a human face or character), a lower foreground_denoise strength can be used to avoid corrupting the subject details.

  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the background of the input image. This can typically be somewhat higher than the foreground motion strength unless the user requests otherwise or wants the background to remain fairly consistent.

  description: AI strength for animating the foreground
  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but can also stray further away from the foreground of the input image. Typically, you want to keep this value in the low range (0.25 - 0.4) to avoid drifting too far away from the main subject in the image. If identity preservation to the input image is not important you can use higher values here to create more creative animation. If it is (eg for human faces), use a lower value like 0.2

  tip: Activate this option to leverage the style_image for generating the animation. Note that the style image will be most active where the denoise value is the highest (foreground and/or background)!
